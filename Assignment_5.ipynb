    "\n",
    "Ans: Delegation is an object oriented technique (also called a design pattern). Let's say we have an object x and want to change the behaviour of just one of its methods. we can create a new class that provides a new implementation of the method we're interested in changing and delegates all other methods to the corresponding method of x.\n",
    "The delegation is accomplished via the getattr method;\n",
    "Delegation can be imlemented easily. For example, the following class implements a class that behaves like a file but converts all written data to uppercase:"
